# Grind75
Tracking my progress through Grind75 (LeetCode problems).

## Process
I created a small script to generate a new Python file for each problem:
```bash
python new.py 'name-of-problem' # creates name-of-problem.py with boilerplate in repo
```
The problem description is listed, and then I write out *in comments* what I plan for the code to do to solve the problem. I then proceed to code the solution.

Once I have a solution that passes the initial test case, I submit it. If the submission fails, I indicate in the comments what test case it fails on and then bump to my next version of solution.

Once I have a submission that passes all test cases, I commit the code, document it in my progress table, and move on to the next problem.

## Language
Python 3
## Constraints
1. Use Google only for language features 
1. No researching solutions until I've written one that passes all test
